        Using heap (more optiaml than sorting slightly less than bucket fill logic)-->without sorting
        ----------------------
     Time Complexity:
     1)  Building the frequency map:
            Iterating through n elements in the input list to calculate frequencies.
            Time Complexity: O(n)
            
    2) Heap operations for the top k elements:
            Insertions or replacements in the heap take O(log k) per element.
            We process all n elements, performing O(log k) operations for each.
            Time Complexity: O(n log k)
            
    3) Extracting the top k elements:
    
            Once the heap is built, extracting all k elements takes O(k log k).
            However, this step is often dominated by the previous step (O(n log k)), so it is negligible.
            
    4) Total Time Complexity:
            O(n log k)

Time Complexity:
---------------------
Sorting both the start and end times: O(n log n)
Iterating through the lists: O(n)
Overall time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of meetings.
  
Space Complexity:
------------------------
O(n) due to the space used by the sorted start and end lists.

###Ouput:
Test Case 1: [[0, 8], [8, 10]]
Sorted Start Times: [0, 8]
Sorted End Times: [8, 10]
Output: 1

Explanation:

Here, there are two meetings: one from 0 to 8 and another from 8 to 10.
The second meeting starts exactly when the first one ends, so there is no overlap.
Since there's no conflict, only 1 room is needed for both meetings.

---------------------------------------------------------

Test Case 2: [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
Sorted Start Times: [0, 5, 15]
Sorted End Times: [10, 20, 30]
Output: 2

Explanation:

The meetings (0, 30) and (5, 10) overlap because the second meeting starts while the first one is still going on. Similarly, (0, 30) and (15, 20) also overlap.
To handle these conflicts, we need 2 rooms: one for (0, 30) and another for (5, 10) or (15, 20).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Test Case 3: [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
Sorted Start Times: [2, 7]
Sorted End Times: [4, 10]
Output: 1

Explanation:

The two meetings are (7, 10) and (2, 4). The second meeting finishes before the first one starts, so thereâ€™s no overlap.
Only 1 room is needed, as both meetings can fit into the same room without any issues.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Test Case 4: [[1, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Sorted Start Times: [1, 2, 3]
Sorted End Times: [3, 4, 5]
Output: 2

Explanation:

Here, the meetings overlap as follows:
(1, 5) overlaps with (2, 3)
(2, 3) overlaps with (3, 4)
In this case, 2 rooms are needed to accommodate all the meetings, as at least two meetings are happening at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Case 5: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Sorted Start Times: [1, 2, 3]
Sorted End Times: [2, 3, 4]
Output: 1

Explanation:

The meetings (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) do not overlap because each meeting ends exactly when the next one starts.
Therefore, only 1 room is needed to accommodate all the meetings.

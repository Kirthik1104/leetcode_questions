        why the above for loop for sorting is necessary
        Example: Consider intervals like [[5, 6], [1, 3], [2, 4]]. If we process  these in the original order:
        --When examining [5, 6], there's no overlap with [1, 3], so we add it to res.
        --When examining [1, 3], we add it to res.
        --Finally, when checking [2, 4], we see it overlaps with [1, 3], so we merge them. But since we didnâ€™t have a sorted order initially, we might not recognize overlaps optimally for all pairs.

        Solution better to sort: Using 1st element

"""
Time Complexity of Your Code
The original code provided has the following time complexities:

Sorting the Intervals: O(nlogn) : The intervals are sorted based on their start times.
-------------------------------

Merging Intervals: O(n): We traverse the sorted list of intervals once to merge them.
-------------------------

Overall Time Complexity: The total time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which results in O(nlogn).

"""
Summary
-----------
In essence, your solution effectively applies a greedy strategy by making a series of local decisions (merging intervals when possible) based on the current state of the solution. This leads to a globally optimal solution for the merging intervals problem, making it a classic example of the greedy algorithm paradigm.
